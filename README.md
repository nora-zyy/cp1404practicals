## Introduction
This repository contains all my assignments for the subject 1404, and weekly assignments, which can be found in different files.

## Clean code
I learnt the following about clean code:
- Use functions that are concise and not repetitive.
- Use consistent indentation, spacing and naming conventions. Make code easier to read and understand.
- Use meaningful names and choose descriptive names for variables, functions and classes. Effectively communicate their purpose and function.
