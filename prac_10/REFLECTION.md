# Estimation of practical tasks
During the completion of tasks, the final code often takes longer to complete than expected. The reason for this may be a lack of care about the knowledge points to the point that even simple code takes longer. Longer code is then written in a framework first before adding to it, making it harder to spot that step causing errors.

# Code review
Reviewing other people's code often improves me, I always find a different perspective on writing code than I do when I review it, and I am more aware of my own shortcomings.
